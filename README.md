Groupees Scraper
================

This program is designed to scrape a copy of your Groupees account, including
bundles, products, keys, and various download links. To help with archival, it
can automatically remove items from trade or giveaway, and automatically
reveal all products and keys. A download list can be generated that includes
both product files and covers.

Usage
-----
There's a CLI now, documentation forthcoming.

TODOs
-----
- Documentation
- Handle giveaway detection
- Try to remove from trade with trades site instead of main site (main site
  seems a bit buggy)

Help wanted
-----------
I don't have any unrevealed products/keys in my account anymore, so I need
someone's help to get the HTML from the new profile so I can parse how those
things work, for the purposes of scraping products obtained from trading.
